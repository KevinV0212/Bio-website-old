# Bio-website
## This is a website to introduce myself
This website doubles as a introduction to me (Kevin Vu) and a way of demonstrating the current level of my front end development ability. Navigation through the site should be fairly straight forward through the navbar at the top right.

The site is written in vanilla HTML and CSS, using the flex-box model to organize elements. With this said, the site is pretty basic but functional.


Currently, the website is optimized for desktop display resolutions but should also be responsive to mobile resolutions.



## Future additions: (Note: this is the first of several versions of my bio website)
- hamburger style list for nav at smaller display sizes
- form to send potential inquiries
- possible style revisions
## Bug Fixes:
- links are hard to click on mobile displays (fixed)
- files are currently gathered into a single root folder. I currently need to study up on how github pages deals with file-paths to resolve this
